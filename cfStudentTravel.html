            KDD is a premier conference that brings together researchers and practitioners from data mining, knowledge discovery, data analytics, and big data. Students, who might otherwise be unable to participate, have now the opportunity to attend sessions, tutorials, and workshops, meet other students and researchers from industry and academia, and take advantage of everything KDD'22 has to offer! <br/>
            KDD'22 will offer travel awards to full-time student attendees. The purpose of the travel grants is to encourage students to participate in the exciting technical and other career enhancement programs at KDD as well as to increase diversity of the participants at the conference. <br />
            The maximum amount of support provided to each grantee is set by the sponsors (ACM SIGKDD, NSF), and they are intended to partially cover the grantee’s expenses. <b>Conference registration will be waived</b> for student travel award grantees. Travel may or may not be partially covered depending on the total availability of funds and the number of awards given. While we encourage submissions from all in need of travel support, the selection process will give higher priority to students with greater involvement in the conference (presenter and co-authors). The allocation of the grants will be based on need, potential impact of the applicant’s attendance in increasing the diversity of the conference participation, and acceptance of student’s publication at KDD ’22. We strongly encourage applications from students who are in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underrepresented_group#:~:text=An%20underrepresented%20group%20describes%20a,holds%20in%20the%20general%20population." target="_blank">underrepresented groups</a>. <br />
            All full-time undergraduate and graduate students interested in data mining or machine learning related research are encouraged to apply. Importantly, SIGKDD encourages participation of women and under-represented minorities, as well as participation of students from under-represented institutions. There is no need to have a paper accepted at the conference to apply. <br />
            Students receiving the travel awards are required to: <br />
            <ul>
            <li>participate in the conference</li>
            <li>assist the conference organizers in numerous activities during the event days (around 3 hours in total)</li>
            <li>submit the original invoice up to the amount of the travel award for reimbursement after the conference. (Instructions will be sent later.)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
