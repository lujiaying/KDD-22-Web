                <h4 class = "instructionText"><b>Who Should Prepare Posters?</b> By default, ALL accepted papers in the research and applied data science tracks as well as the undergraduate consortium are required to prepare posters and have been assigned a poster spot. However, we understand that some authors may not be able to travel due to COVID regulations. If you are unable to travel and have made a “No Proxy” declaration (i.e., you could not find a registered proxy to present your paper), we will not be assigning a poster spot for your paper.

                <h4 class = "instructionText">Both sessions will be held in the <b>EXHIBIT HALL</b> at the Washington DC Convention Center. For each poster session day, authors (or their registered proxies) should set up their posters between 3 pm to 5 pm. After the poster session ends, presenters should remove their posters. Any posters left in the Exhibit Hall may be discarded. Your paper is assigned a board number, which is used to locate the position of your poster. The board number can be found in the program booklet (to be distributed at the registration desk and to be made available on the KDD website).</h4>
                
                <h4 class = "instructionText"><b>Poster Presentation Instructions: </b>The size limit for each poster is 1 meter by 1 meter (39.3 inches by 39.3 inches). Your posters need to fit within this size. Specific areas will be labeled in the Exhibit Hall to allow you to locate where to place your posters. </h4>

In other words, there are no constraints in terms of the orientation and size of the poster as long as it fits within the assigned area on the poster board.</h5>
