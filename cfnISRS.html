            <p class="cfpText">
              ACM SIGKDD decided to establish the Rising Star Award starting in 2020. This award is based on an individual’s whole body of work in the first five years after the PhD. The award aims to promote current SIGKDD researchers as they build up their career.<br><br>

              The previous SIGKDD Rising Star Award winners were Danai Koutra, Jiliang Tang, and Xia Ben Hu.<br><br>

              <b>Eligibility:</b> The nominee(s) should have completed all the requirements for the PhD no earlier than December 31, 2016; parental leaves will move the date by the duration of the parental leave.
