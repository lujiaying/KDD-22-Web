I  will focus on  domains of public health and conservation,  and address one key cross-cutting challenge: how to effectively deploy our limited intervention resources in these problem domains. I will present results from work around the globe in using AI for challenges in public health such as Maternal and Child care interventions, HIV prevention, and in conservation such as  endangered wildlife protection. Achieving social impact in these domains often requires methodological advances. To that end, I will highlight key research advances in multiagent reasoning and learning, in particular in, restless multiarmed bandits, influence maximization in social networks, computational game theory and decision-focused learning. In pushing this research agenda, our ultimate goal is to facilitate local communities and non-profits to directly benefit from advances in AI tools and techniques.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 15px;color:#655D5B;">What are data and network models? What are efficient algorithms? What are meaningful solutions? Big Data, Network Sciences, and Machine Learning have fundamentally challenged the basic characterizations in computing, from the conventional graph-theoretical modeling of networks to the traditional polynomial-time worst-case measures of efficiency:
                    <br />
                    -- For a long time, graphs have been widely used for defining the structure of social and information networks. However, real-world network data and phenomena are much richer and more complex than what can be captured by nodes and edges. Network data is multifaceted, and thus network sciences require new theories, going beyond classic graph theory and graph-theoretical frameworks, to capture the multifaceted data.
                    <br />
                    -- More than ever before, it is not just desirable, but essential, that efficient algorithms should be scalable. In other words, their complexity should be nearly linear or even sub-linear with respect to the problem size. Thus, scalability, not just polynomial-time computability, should be elevated as the central complexity notion for characterizing efficient computation.
                    <br />
                    In this talk, I will discuss some aspects of these challenges.  Using basic tasks in network analysis, geometric embedding, game theory, and machine learning as examples, I will highlight the role of big models, scalable algorithms and axiomatization in shaping our understanding of "effective solution concepts," which need to be both mathematically meaningful and algorithmically efficient.</p>

He is a fellow of SIAM, ACM, and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and has twice won the Gödel Prize, first in 2008, for developing smoothed analysis, and then in 2015, for designing the breakthrough scalable Laplacian solver. Citing him as, “one of the most original theoretical computer scientists in the world”, the Simons Foundation named him a 2014 Simons Investigator to pursue long-term curiosity-driven fundamental research. He also received the 2009 Fulkerson Prize, 2021 ACM STOC Test of Time Award (for smoothed analysis), 2022 ACM SIGecom Test of Time Award (for settling the complexity of computing a Nash equilibrium), and 2011 ACM STOC Best Paper Award (for improving maximum-flow minimum-cut algorithms). In addition, he and collaborators developed the first optimal well-shaped Delaunay mesh generation algorithms for arbitrary three-dimensional domains, settled the Rousseeuw-Hubert regression-depth conjecture in robust statistics, and resolved two long-standing complexity-theoretical questions regarding the Sprague-Grundy theorem in combinatorial game theory. For his industry work with Xerox, NASA, Intel, IBM, Akamai, and Microsoft, he received fifteen patents in areas including compiler optimization, Internet technology, and social networks. Dedicated to teaching his daughter to speak Chinese as the sole Chinese-speaking parent in an otherwise English-speaking family and environment, he has also become fascinated with children's bilingual learning.</p>
