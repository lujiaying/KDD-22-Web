                <div class="row">
                  <p style="font-size: 15px;color:#655D5B;">Healthcare is different from any other application domain, or is it not? While it is true that there are specific aspects, such as high stakes decisions and a complex regulatory framework, that make healthcare somewhat different, it is also the case that many of the lessons learned from building data-driven products in other domains translate remarKably well into healthcare. This is particularly so because healthcare is also a user facing domain, where users can be both patients or healthcare professionals. Given that data has shown to improve user experience while ensuring quality and scalability, few would argue that healthcare cannot benefit from being much more data-driven than it has traditionally been. In this talk, I will describe how this experience building impactful data and AI solutions into user facing products for decades can be leveraged to revolutionize telehealth. At Curai, we combine approaches such as state-of-the-art large language models with expert systems in areas such as NLP, vision, and automated diagnosis to augment and scale doctors, and to improve user experience and healthcare outcomes. We will see some of those applications while analyzing the role of data and ML algorithms in making them possible.</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 15px;color:#655D5B;">Large-scale vision models, pre-trained on vast quantities of often unlabelled data, give state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuned for a wide variety of downstream tasks. For these downstream tasks, the amount of training data available is usually orders of magnitude less than what was used during pre-training. And in many cases, there is little to no labelled data available. In this talk, I discuss approaches to leveraging pre-trained models for vision tasks in low-data regimes. Focusing on video segmentation and object detection, I show that incorporating domain-specific and modality-specific inductive biases lead to improved model performance when training data is limited.</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 15px;color:#655D5B;">Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to improve public health as well as revolutionize many sectors of the economy. To realize that potential, AV deployment needs to be safe, responsible, and efficient/cost-effective. Data science, a combination of disciplines including statistics, data engineering, computer science, and operations research, with a bias toward applications, can support these AV deployment goals. We describe two (high-level) case studies applying data science at Cruise. The first considers how to test AV performance in a simulated environment. Specifically, we sketch a framework for measuring “scenario realism”, a metric for how likely a given scenario is to occur on-road. This metric includes multiple dimensions/sub-metrics, such as “Perception realism” and “policy realism”. We then describe some potential benefits of both realistic and “unrealistic” scenarios to help measure and improve AV safety. A second case study describes how data science is used to help improve the efficiency of AV deployment. Specifically, given that AVs travel along a road network to serve rider demand, various constraints imposed by this network are discussed and methods to optimize service subject to these constraints are described.</p>

                <div class="row">
                  <p style="font-size: 15px;color:#655D5B;">Large scale recommender systems conduct many millions of inferences on each given day, involving millions of users and items. Each online inference (recommending a small set of items to a user) is usually done using a scoring function that combines many estimated utilities (e.g., pClck, pView, pSkip) to score candidate items. The combination is usually formed in an ad hoc fashion. Linear programming (LP) offers a systematic approach to form this combination by posing global inference objectives and constraints on the utilities. The same LP approach easily extends to applications in which users and items need to be matched while satisfying a huge number of item level global constraints. Such LPs are of an extreme scale - having many billions of variables. A scalable LP solver named DuaLip has been developed for such LPs and open-sourced. A practical design approach using DuaLip has also been used successfully in several applications. This talk will give an overview of the problem, the class of applications, the DuaLip LP solver, and the practical design approach.</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 15px;color:#655D5B;">Pre-trained large language models (PLM) have made breakthroughs in transfer learning of a wide range of NLP tasks, including intent representation and language generation. In this talk we will present some recent work we have done in PLM for natural language generation to improve different aspects of model capability and model transferability, as well as their applications in online advertising automation. To address the limitation of NLG models’ generative commonsense reasoning performance, we developed Knowledge Filtering and Contrastive learning Network (KFCNet) which retrieves external knowledge base to enrich the inputs with high quality contextual prototypes and applies contrastive learning separately to each of the encoder and decoder, within a general encoder--decoder architecture. KFCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in many generative reasoning tasks and is deployed in Microsoft advertising system for query rewriting.  Targeting NLG tasks in the marketing and advertising domains, we developed CULG model, a cross-lingual commercial universal language generation model. We proposed 4 commercial generation tasks and a two-stage training strategy for pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed strategy yields performance improvements on several commercial generation tasks by a large margin as compared to single-stage pre-training. To speed up NLG model inference without sacrificing performance, we developed BANG, a new pretraining model to Bridge the gap between Autoregressive (AR) and Non-autoregressive (NAR) Generation. The pretrained BANG model can simultaneously support AR, NAR and semi-NAR generation to meet different requirements. Experiments on many NLG tasks show that BANG improves NAR and semi-NAR performance significantly as well as attaining comparable performance with strong AR pretrained models, with much higher inference speed. BANG is deployed in Microsoft online advertising systems for online serving to handle.</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 15px;color:#655D5B;">Eye movements are thought to be a window to the mind, and have been extensively studied across Neuroscience, Psychology and HCI. However, progress in this area has been severely limited as the underlying eye tracking technology relies on specialized hardware that is expensive (upto $30,000) and hard to scale. In this talk, I will present our recent work from Google, which shows that ML applied to smartphone selfie cameras can enable accurate gaze estimation, comparable to state-of-the-art hardware based mobile eye trackers, at 1/100th the cost and without any additional hardware. Via extensive experiments, we show that our smartphone gaze tech can successfully replicate key findings from prior eye movement research in Neuroscience and Psychology, across a variety of tasks including traditional oculomotor tasks, saliency analyses on natural images and reading comprehension. We also show that smartphone gaze could serve as a potential digital biomarker for detecting mental fatigue. These results show that smartphone gaze technology has the potential to unlock advances by scaling eye movement research, and enabling new applications for improved wellness and accessibility, such as gaze-based interaction for patients with ALS/stroke that cannot otherwise interact with devices</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 15px;color:#655D5B;">The recent controversies of Health AI applications and algorithmic bias have sparked an ongoing debate about the ethics and responsibility of such applications on patient care that would directly affect outcomes and healthcare quality. Following the 21st Century Care Act, FDA has released guidelines in software as a medical device (SaMD) and Real-World Evidence (RWE), approved more than 60 SaMD applications, and incorporated RWE in more than 100 decisions of the recent applications of new drugs and biologics. However, as the nature of Health AI applications has incurred a new set of considerations in AI adoption, we still need to curate more best practice examples and converge on a set of industry standards for defining and enabling responsible and ethical AI in healthcare. This talk will review the recent development of the accountable AI evaluation and deployment framework. We will also discuss a couple of case studies, such as the recently published Sepsis studies in Nature Medicine, to assess the impact of clinical AI adoption and behavioral change on patient outcomes and care quality (e.g., the reduction of mortality rate by 18.2% with the clinical adoption rate of 90%). In addition, with the increased staff shortage and clinician burnout rate, the healthcare industry is also going through significant consolidations and transitions, putting AI adoption at the center of business priorities. Therefore, this talk will also introduce an AI Implementation Checklist and illustrate the best practice in the full spectrum of real-world evidence validation and bias detection and mitigation.</p>
