            <p class="cfpText"><strong>The community for data mining, data science and analysis.</strong> </p>
            <p class="cfpText">
            Started in 1989, KDD is the oldest &amp; largest data mining conference worldwide. It is home to some of the first &amp; most highly cited research papers in fields which are now popularly known as “Big Data”, “Data Science”, and “Predictive Analytics”. Innovations like Crowdsourcing, large-scale data science competitions, personalized advertising (e.g. Google etc.), graph mining algorithms (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn etc.) and recommender systems (e.g. Netflix, Amazon etc.) all originated at KDD.

            <p class="cfpTitle">Why should you sponsor KDD?</p>
            <p class="cfpText">
            <b>Recruitment:</b> KDD provides multiple avenues for you to meet and recruit the best and brightest minds in the field of data science, analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and Big Data. KDD facilitates this explicitly through sharing your job postings with attendees directly (Platinum, Gold, and Silver sponsorship level), through job matching (where candidates can express interest in your jobs) and through Exhibition booths (where you can showcase your company &amp; jobs, arrange meetings, set up Q&amp;A with your experts etc.).
            </p>
            <p class="cfpText">
            <b>Branding:</b> KDD is known as a home for industry-defining innovations and high quality rigorously peer-reviewed research. Sponsoring KDD is an opportunity for you to brand with over a quarter century of high-quality data science that KDD has come to represent. This is a way for you to stay on top of minds for data science professionals and candidates that may look for their next place to work in a few months or years.
            </p>
            <p class="cfpText">
           <b>Customers:</b> In addition to facilitating recruitment, KDD also provides an opportunity for you to reach out to your potential customers. Companies such as Elder Research, Salford Systems, Oracle, SAS, and many startups use the exhibition booth as a venue to advertise &amp; meet new customers. Most leading book publishers use our conference to advertise and sell the latest books to the largest gathering of data mining researchers.
            </p>
            <p class="cfpText">
            <b>Community:</b> Many of us now work in research disciplines and industries that many years ago were mere nascent ideas being discussed at KDD. Supporting KDD through sponsorship is a way for you to support the international community of researchers that are working on data-driven ideas that will define economies of tomorrow. Quite explicitly, corporate sponsorship helps us keep the registration costs affordable for students and international attendees.
            </p>
